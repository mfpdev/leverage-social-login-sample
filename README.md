IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation
===================================

## Analyze My Facebook
Have you ever wanted to know what's your profile picture is telling about your age or gender?
Have you ever wanted to know what's your Facebook feed is telling about your personality? Or about your tone?
You can take this sample and try to think about real world use case such as ads platform that customize the ads based on user personality, age or gender.


This sample can do that by using [IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation 8.0](https://developer.ibm.com/mobilefirstplatform/) and [Watson services](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/services-catalog.html).

## Running the sample application
 * Running the sample take into consideration that you are familiar with adapters and MobileFirst CLI. If it is not the case, please follow theses guides:  

    1. [Adapters](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/adapters/)
    2. [MobileFirst CLI](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/using-the-mfpf-sdk/using-mobilefirst-cli-to-manage-mobilefirst-artifacts/)  

 * Build and deploy adapters  
    You need to build and deploy two adapters.  
    From the terminal go to the root of each adapter and run the following lines in the command line:
    ```
    mfpdev adapter build
  mfpdev adapter deploy
    ```

    1. [AnalyzeMyFacebookAdapter](./AnalyzeMyFacebookAdapter/README.md) - this is the resource adapter which has protected REST API /analyze.  The /analyze API fetch user profile information and feed from Facebook and sends them to Watson to obtain insights.
    2. [social-login-security-check](./social-login-security-check/README.md) - this is the security check adapter which can validate social platform users (Facebook or Google).  
    You must set the property `keepOriginalToken` to `true`. This property allows the adapter to store the original Facebook token to be used when calling [Facebook graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api).  

* Register the app
   1. From the root of the Android project run the following line in command line
      `mfpdev app register`  


 * Android Native App
    1. You need to obtain an `appId` from Facebook by adding a new Android app in [Facebook Developer Console](https://developers.facebook.com/).
    2. Add the `appId` to `facebook_app_id` in the `string.xml` file.
    3. Set your MFP server URL in `mfpclient.properties`.

  * You can run the app now.
