## Analyze My Facebook Adapter
This adapter demonstrate:

1. Ability to protect resource using facebook login.
2. How to connect to [Watson services](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/services-catalog.html) like:
    * [AlchemyAPI](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/alchemy-language.html)
    * [Personality Insights](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/personality-insights.html)
    * [Tone Analyzer](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/tone-analyzer.html)
3. This adapter obtains a Facebook access token from the logged-in user and provides insights based on the user profile picture and the user feed.
4. To test this adapter you can use the following native Android app [AnalyzeMyFacebookApp](../AnalyzeMyFacebookApp/README.md)

## Maven
* The adapter is a [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) project.  It's easy to add dependencies:  
e.g.: to add [Watson Java SDK](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/java-sdk) all is needed - add those lines to dependencies node in [pom.xml](pom.xml):
```
<dependency>
         <groupId>com.ibm.watson.developer_cloud</groupId>
         <artifactId>java-sdk</artifactId>
         <version>2.9.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Prerequisites
* A local installation of maven (JDK 1.7 or 1.8)

### Build and install
* Deploy the [social-login](../social-login-security-check/README.md) security check (under custom-security-checks folder)
* build the adapter application using maven:
    * From a **Command-line**, navigate to the **AnalyzeMyFacebookAdapter** project's root folder
    * Build the API using maven by executing `mvn clean install`
* Deploy the built adapter into your MobileFirst server by running `mvn adapter:deploy` (assure that your MobileFirst
  server connection parameters are updated in the **pom.xml** file)
* Log into the MobileFirst console and update the Adapter configuration parameters
    * `alchemyAPIKey` - You can obtain it from a bounded [AlchemyAPI service](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/alchemy-language.html) in [BlueMix](http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/).
    * `personalityInsightUser` & `personalityInsightPassword` - You can obtain it from the a bounded [Personality Insights Watson service](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/personality-insights.html) in [BlueMix](http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/).     
    * `toneAnalyzerUser` & `toneAnalyzerPassword` - You can obtain it from the a bounded [TokenAnalyzer Watson service](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/tone-analyzer.html) in [BlueMix](http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/).

* You are done.
* To test it you can use this Android sample [AnalyzeMyFacebookApp](../AnalyzeMyFacebookApp/README.md)

**Where can I find the services credentials in [BlueMix](http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/)?
You can find the service credentials in your [BlueMix](http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/) runtime application, under each service box:
